Win32/TieRegistry/PMVersionInfo version 0.01
============================================

    This module mirrors to the Win32 registry version information from a
    perl module's heirachy.

    It offers no support for reading the information - for that use the
    "Win32::TieRegistry" module on which this module is based.

    Version information is ascertained using the same method as in
    "ExtUtils::MakeMaker" version 5.45. To quote that module's manpage:

            The first line in the file that contains the regular expression

                    /([\$*])(([\w\:\']*)\bVERSION)\b.*\=/

            will be evaluated with eval() and the value of the named variable
            after the eval() will be assigned to the VERSION attribute of the
            MakeMaker object. The following lines will be parsed o.k.:

                    $VERSION = '1.00';
                    *VERSION = \'1.01';
                    ( $VERSION ) = '$Revision: 1.222 $ ' =~ /\$Revision:\s+([^\s]+)/;
                    $FOO::VERSION = '1.10';
                    *FOO::VERSION = \'1.11';
                    our $VERSION = 1.2.3;       # new for perl5.6.0

            but these will fail:

                    my $VERSION = '1.01';
                    local $VERSION = '1.02';
                    local $FOO::VERSION = '1.30';

            (Putting "my" or "local" on the preceding line will work o.k.)

	For further information, please see the PM's inline POD.
